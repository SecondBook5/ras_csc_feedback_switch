# Figure 4 Parameter Extraction Summary (paper_figure4.md)

This document summarizes the quantitative and model-relevant information extracted from **Figure 4** of *Yuan et al., Nature 2022*, focused on how **angiogenesis elevates local leptin in the tumour microenvironment** and how **circulating leptin modulates SCC growth**.

Figure 4 constrains the **Leptin (L)** layer and its links to **angiogenesis (A)** and **tumour growth / CSC dynamics (C)**.

## 1. Panel 4a – Tumour tissue leptin in papilloma versus SCC

Source: ELISA on tumour lysates, leptin in pg g⁻¹ tissue.

Raw data:

| Stage     | Values (pg g⁻¹)                                      | Mean (pg g⁻¹) |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Papilloma | 1609.534, 1174.86, 943.9338, 1118.26                | 1,211.64      |
| SCC       | 9,908.97, 2,197.55, 8,671.412, 4,280.105            | 6,255.51      |

Fold-change:

- **L_tissue,SCC / L_tissue,Pap ≈ 6,255.51 / 1,211.64 ≈ 5.17**

Model implication:

- Define a **local leptin state variable** \(L\) in tumour tissue.
- Normalise:
  - **L_pap = 1.0**
  - **L_scc ≈ 5.2**

This choice matches the ~5.2-fold increase in tissue leptin between papilloma and SCC.

## 2. Panel 4c – Lep mRNA levels in microenvironmental compartments

Source: qPCR for Lep mRNA in whole tissues and FACS subsets.

Raw data (mRNA Lep):

- Skin: 0, 0, 0  
- White fat (positive control): 4.686, 7.141, 1.000  
- Papilloma: 0, 0, 0  
- SCC: 0, 0, 0  
- CD45⁺: all 0  
- CD140a⁺: all 0  
- CD117⁺: all 0  
- CD31⁺: all 0  

Interpretation:

- **No detectable Lep transcription in tumour, stroma, or vascular fractions.**
- White fat beneath normal skin expresses Lep, confirming assay sensitivity.

Model implication:

- Local tumour leptin is **not** generated by Lep expression in tumour or local stromal cells.
- Leptin is likely imported from systemic sources and concentrated in the tumour microenvironment via **vasculature-dependent mechanisms**.
- The model should treat **L_tissue** as a function of **angiogenesis (A)** and systemic leptin, not as an independent production term in tumour cells.

## 3. Panel 4d – Plasma leptin in normal, papilloma and SCC-bearing mice

Source: ELISA on blood plasma, pg g⁻¹ (effectively ng ml⁻¹ scale).

Raw data and means:

- Normal: 1,344.32; 6,431.64; 5,413.2; 5,373.76; 3,289.27; 1,096.65  
  - Mean ≈ **3,824.14**
- Papilloma: 4,683.84; 3,522.4; 2,481.78; 1,046.64; 2,798.72; 1,227.5  
  - Mean ≈ **2,960.81**
- SCC: 1,622.7; 5,339.51; 2,688.72; 7,710.95; 674.53; 5,359.815  
  - Mean ≈ **3,566.66**

Conclusions:

- Plasma leptin levels are **comparable across normal, papilloma, and SCC**; differences are not significant.
- **Systemic leptin is roughly constant**, while **local tumour leptin (panel 4a)** rises strongly in SCC.

Model implication:

- Introduce a **systemic leptin baseline** \(L_\text{plasma}\) that is approximately constant across states.
  - Normalisation: **L_plasma ≈ 1.0** for all stages.
- The **tumour tissue leptin variable \(L\)** should be modelled as **angiogenesis-dependent accumulation** above this systemic baseline, not as large systemic shifts.

## 4. Panel 4e – Effect of rmVEGFA on tumour growth and CD31⁺ vasculature

### 4e left – Tumour volume with and without rmVEGFA

Vehicle vs rmVEGFA, PDV SCC tumours, volumes in mm³.

At day 45 (end time-point):

- Vehicle (8 tumours):  
  338, 244.4, 302.8, 148.3, 107.4, 205.5, 174.1, 365.9  
  - Mean ≈ **235.30**
- rmVEGFA (8 tumours):  
  960.8, 688.6, 409.1, 582.1, 346.9, 680.3, 581.7, 655.2  
  - Mean ≈ **612.46**

Fold-change in tumour volume at endpoint:

- **V_VEGFA / V_vehicle ≈ 612.46 / 235.30 ≈ 2.60**

Interpretation:

- **Exogenous VEGFA roughly 2.6-fold increases tumour volume** at the late timepoint.

### 4e right – CD31⁺ fraction with and without rmVEGFA

Fraction of CD31⁺ cells (% of live cells):

- Vehicle: 1.39, 2.74, 0.93, 0.95  
  - Mean ≈ **1.75**
- rmVEGFA: 2.81, 2.70, 2.15, 3.37  
  - Mean ≈ **2.76**

Fold-change in vasculature:

- **CD31⁺_VEGFA / CD31⁺_vehicle ≈ 2.76 / 1.75 ≈ 1.58**

(Using the raw numbers alone; the paper reports a similar magnitude.)

Model implication:

- VEGFA elevation increases **angiogenesis A** by roughly **1.6–1.8-fold**, which in turn boosts tumour growth by about **2.6-fold**.
- This supports a **super-linear effect of A on growth**, consistent with Lepr-dependent CSC amplification.

## 5. Panel 4f – Vegfa overexpression in CSCs: local angiogenesis and leptin

### 4f left – CD31⁺ fraction (angiogenesis) with TRE-Vegfa

CD31⁺ cells % of live:

- Control: 2.9, 2.0, 1.4  
  - Mean ≈ **2.10**
- TRE-Vegfa: 3.9, 4.6, 4.0  
  - Mean ≈ **4.17**

Fold-change:

- **A_TRE-Vegfa / A_control ≈ 4.17 / 2.10 ≈ 1.99**

So CSC-driven Vegfa roughly **doubles angiogenesis**.

### 4f right – Tumour tissue leptin with TRE-Vegfa

Leptin pg ml⁻¹ in tumour tissue:

- Control: 433.28, 145.2, 35.58, 319.548, 347.548  
  - Mean ≈ **256.63**
- TRE-Vegfa: 6,355.96, 582.84, 7,822.72, 2,958.64, 11,516.08, 6,298.64  
  - Mean ≈ **4,643.15**

Fold-change:

- **L_TRE-Vegfa / L_control ≈ 4,643.15 / 256.63 ≈ 18.1**

Interpretation:

- A **two-fold increase in angiogenesis yields an ~18-fold increase in local tumour leptin**.
- This is a very strong, non-linear amplification from A to L.

Model implication:

- The A→L mapping must be **strongly non-linear**. A Hill-type relationship is appropriate:

  \[
  L_\text{tissue}(A) = L_\text{basal} + \eta_{AL}\,\frac{A^{n_{AL}}}{K_{AL}^{n_{AL}} + A^{n_{AL}}}
  \]

  with:
  - \(n_{AL}\) moderate to high (for example 2–3),
  - \(K_{AL}\) on the order of the angiogenic level of advanced papillomas,
  - \(\eta_{AL}\) chosen so that:
    - \(L(A_\text{pap}) \approx 1.0\),
    - \(L(A_\text{scc}) \approx 5.2\),
    - a two-fold perturbation of A (Vegfa overexpression) can reach ~18-fold local L.

Provisional model constraints:

- **n_AL ≥ 2** (super-linear response).
- **A fold-change of ~2 should be able to reproduce ~18-fold L**, when starting from a partially activated state.

## 6. Panel 4g – Systemic leptin and agonist effects on tumour growth

Tumour growth measured as percentage of size at week 3 (all groups 100%).

Week 5 data (growth factor; percentages relative to week 3):

- PBS (12 tumours): mean ≈ **824.75**
- Leptin 2 mg ml⁻¹ (8 tumours): mean ≈ **2,356.19**
- Leptin 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ (8 tumours): mean ≈ **1,332.03**
- SMLA 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ (8 tumours): mean ≈ **583.40**

Fold-changes relative to PBS:

- **High leptin (2 mg ml⁻¹)**:  
  \( \approx 2.86 \times \) PBS growth.
- **Low leptin (0.5 mg ml⁻¹)**:  
  \( \approx 1.62 \times \) PBS growth.
- **SMLA partial agonist (0.5 mg ml⁻¹)**:  
  \( \approx 0.71 \times \) PBS growth (growth suppression).

Interpretation:

- Tumour growth is **sensitive to systemic leptin level** in a dose-dependent fashion.
- The SMLA mutant acts as a **functional antagonist or partial agonist**, reducing effective leptin signalling through LEPR.

Model implication:

- Introduce a **systemic leptin effect term** that modulates CSC proliferation or effective growth rate through LEPR:

  \[
  k_\text{growth}^\text{eff} = k_\text{base} \cdot f(L_\text{plasma}, R)
  \]

  where \(f\) satisfies:

  - \(f(L_\text{baseline}) = 1\) (PBS),
  - \(f(L_\text{high}) \approx 2.9\),
  - \(f(L_\text{low}) \approx 1.6\),
  - \(f(L_\text{SMLA}) \approx 0.7\).

- In practice this can be implemented as a Hill function of **LEPR-bound leptin** or as a simple linear gain for a first pass, then refined.

## 7. Provisional model variables and parameters from Figure 4

These are the concrete quantities from Figure 4 that should enter `model_parameters.yaml` (values can be normalised as indicated):

### New state variables

- **L_pap = 1.0**  
  Normalised leptin in tumour tissue in papilloma (from 4a).

- **L_scc ≈ 5.2**  
  Normalised leptin in tumour tissue in SCC (from 4a, ~5.17-fold increase).

- **L_plasma ≈ 1.0**  
  Baseline systemic leptin (4d, roughly constant across conditions).

### New interaction parameters (A → L and L → growth)

Provisional placeholders to be added under appropriate blocks:

- **A → L (angiogenesis to local leptin)**

  - `K_AL`: angiogenesis threshold for leptin accumulation.  
    - Set between **A_pap = 1.0** and **A_scc = 93.7**, for example **K_AL ≈ 40**.
  - `n_AL`: Hill coefficient for A→L.  
    - Use **n_AL ≈ 2–3**, to allow a two-fold increase in A to produce ~18-fold L as observed in 4f.
  - `eta_AL`: maximal contribution of angiogenesis to leptin above baseline.  
    - Choose `eta_AL` so that:
      - L(A_pap) ≈ 1.0,  
      - L(A_scc) ≈ 5.2,  
      - L(2×A_control) ≈ 18×L_control in the Vegfa experiment.

- **Systemic leptin / agonist effects on growth**

  - `eta_L_high`: growth multiplier at high leptin (2 mg ml⁻¹) ≈ **2.9**.  
  - `eta_L_low`: growth multiplier at low leptin (0.5 mg ml⁻¹) ≈ **1.6**.  
  - `eta_SMLA`: growth multiplier under SMLA ≈ **0.7**.

  These can either be treated as:
  - direct scaling factors on a growth term in specific simulation conditions, or
  - calibration points for a continuous function \(f(L_\text{plasma})\).

## 8. Summary

Figure 4 provides:

1. A **quantitative mapping from angiogenesis to local leptin** (strong, non-linear amplification).
2. Evidence that **systemic leptin is relatively constant** across tumour stages, so the key modulation is **local microenvironmental leptin**.
3. A **dose–response relationship between systemic leptin and SCC growth**, including an inhibitory SMLA condition.

These results should be encoded in the model as:

- Normalised **L_pap = 1.0**, **L_scc ≈ 5.2**, **L_plasma = 1.0**.
- A strongly non-linear **A→L** interaction (parameters `K_AL`, `n_AL`, `eta_AL`).
- A leptin-dependent growth modulation (`eta_L_high`, `eta_L_low`, `eta_SMLA`) that interacts with **LEPR (R)** from Figures 2–3.
