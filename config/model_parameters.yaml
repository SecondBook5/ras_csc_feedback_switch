                              # These two together constrain the nonlinearity (n_LA) and prefactor for A → L in the model.

systemic_leptin_effects:
  # Plasma leptin baseline — roughly similar across groups (no strong trend; Fig. 4d), so we treat
  # plasma leptin as a modulatory factor that can be driven up or down experimentally.
  lambda_PBS: 1.0            # Baseline systemic leptin effect on growth (PBS osmotic pump control; Fig. 4g)

  lambda_lep_high: 2.86      # Growth multiplier with leptin 2 mg ml^-1 vs PBS at week 5
                             # (mean ≈2356 / 825; Fig. 4g; paper_figure4.md)

  lambda_lep_low: 1.62       # Growth multiplier with leptin 0.5 mg ml^-1 vs PBS at week 5
                             # (mean ≈1332 / 825; Fig. 4g)

                             # (mean ≈583 / 825; Fig. 4g). SMLA acts effectively as a growth-suppressive condition here.

# ==========================================================
# PI3K–AKT / mTOR signalling constraints (Figure 5)
# These capture how much of PI3K / mTOR-driven growth is LEPR-dependent
# and how much growth remains under pathway inhibition.
# ==========================================================
pi3k_mtor_effects:
  # Relative contribution of the two arms within the LEPR programme
  omega_PI3K: 0.60           # Fraction of LEPR growth routed through PI3K–AKT

  omega_mTOR: 0.40           # Fraction of LEPR growth routed through mTORC1
                             # (Fig. 5e–g: strong pS6 / pS6K response)

  # PI3K inhibitor (BKM120) — Fig. 5d

                                 # (mean of Leprnull and Leprctrl residual ratios at day 28)
  pi3k_lepr_fraction: 0.87       # ≈87% of PI3K-sensitive growth is LEPR-mediated
                                 # (drop in Leprctrl vs Leprnull volumes under BKM120)

  # mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) — Fig. 5h
  mtor_residual_fraction: 0.32   # ≈30% of growth persists with rapamycin
                                 # (mean of Leprnull and Leprctrl residual ratios at week 6)
  mtor_lepr_fraction: 0.71       # ≈71% of mTOR-sensitive growth is LEPR-mediated
                                 # (drop in Leprctrl vs Leprnull volumes under rapamycin)

  # Structural note:
  # In the ODEs, these fractions should scale the effective growth-rate term g(C, R)
  # so that:
  #   - turning off PI3K leaves pi3k_residual_fraction of growth,
  #   - turning off mTOR leaves mtor_residual_fraction of growth,
  #   - LEPR-dependent contributions are weighted by pi3k_lepr_fraction / mtor_lepr_fraction.
